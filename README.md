# R-for-Bioinformatics
Analysis of Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Alterations in Glioblastoma comparing with Healthy Cell

## Background
I come from a biomedical science background and am currently transitioning towards bioinformatics and data-driven research in precision medicine. This repository documents my early-stage training in R for bioinformatics and biological data analysis.

## What this repository contains
- Basic R scripts for data handling and visualization
- Exploratory data analysis applied to biological datasets
- Coursework and self-directed exercises related to bioinformatics

## Skills and concepts covered
- Data manipulation and preprocessing in R
  Importing, cleaning, and structuring gene expression       data for downstream analysis.
- Exploratory and statistical analysis of biological data
  Performing differential expression, survival analysis,     and basic statistical comparisons across biological groups.
- Dimensionality reduction and multivariate analysis
  Using PCA to assess data quality and sample separation.
- Visualization and interpretation of omics data
  Creating and interpreting MA plots, volcano plots,         heatmaps, and pathway enrichment visualisations.
- Reproducible analysis workflow
  Organising scripts, figures, and written interpretation    in a transparent and reproducible manner.
  
## Why this matters
Through these exercises, I aim to build a solid computational foundation to support
future research in biological data analysis, multi-omics analysis, and translational medicine.

## Current limitations and next steps
These projects represent an introductory stage of my training in R for biological data analysis.
I aim to further develop my skills in statistical modelling and data-driven analysis of complex and longitudinal biomedical data, with particular interest in modelling change over time, handling missing and heterogeneous data, and integrating biological, behavioural, and clinical information.
